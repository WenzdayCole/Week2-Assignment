# Week2-Assignment
Well, well, well...Just as expected. (check console.log)
It's 20:34 on Sunday as I'm wrting this and I give up.
No idea what my js does (apart from the object of course),
I probably wouldn't have any code if not for the guys who posted screen shots on discord.
I thought that if I add some css something would appear on screen. 

I think my biggest problem is not understanding or, not being able to figure out 
the steps needed in order to go from blank page, to something working (in js mainly).
CONFESSION: I even looked at the git hub accounts of past student's to try to find this assignment,
but wasn't able to.
